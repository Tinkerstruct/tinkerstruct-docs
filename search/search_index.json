[!important] Notion Tip: Here at Notion we use this template to help teams plan, design and develop products with the greatest chance for success. It helps teams think through their work more deeply, improves asynchronous communication with other teams, and creates space for collaboration. Problem == Example questions to answer: ==== What problem are we solving? For whom? When do they experience this issue? What data, research and feedback do we have that explains this problem? Which customers are we working with, or hearing from, to better understand this problem? Why is solving this problem urgent? Why is it important? == \ud83d\udcad Proposal == Example questions to answer: ==== How are we solving this issue? What alternatives did we consider? Why did we land with this? What is the general shape of this solution? Do you have any mocks, prototypes, relevant comparisons in the market? How will we know that we\u2019ve solved this issue? What will we measure?
